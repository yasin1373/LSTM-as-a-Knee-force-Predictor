//About the Project//

The SquatForce Predictor is a deep learning project that predicts the total knee joint force during a squat based on electromyography (EMG) data from muscles involved in the squat. It uses advanced technique like LSTM(Long short-term memory network) to provide insights into the biomechanics of squat exercises, which can be valuable for both athletes and researchers.
